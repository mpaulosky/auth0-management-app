# ISSUES

Here are the open issues in the repo:

<issues-json>

{{ISSUES_JSON}}

</issues-json>

The list above has already been filtered to issues ready for work.
Issues with an explicit blocker (a GitHub "blocked by" link, or a "Blocked by #N" or "Depends on #N" line) whose work hasn't landed on main were removed before you saw the list.
So don't hold an issue back only because its body mentions an issue that isn't in the list: that issue is either finished or outside this backlog.

# TASK

Analyze the open issues and build a dependency graph. For each issue, determine whether it **blocks** or **is blocked by** any other open issue.

An issue B is **blocked by** issue A if:

- B requires code or infrastructure that A introduces
- B and A modify overlapping files or modules, making concurrent work likely to produce merge conflicts
- B's requirements depend on a decision or API shape that A will establish

An issue is **unblocked** if it has zero blocking dependencies on other open issues.

# ROLES

The tester, the backend developer and the reviewer build every issue. For each issue you pick, also choose which optional roles it needs, in a `roles` list. Pick a role only
when the issue needs it: each one costs a run.

- `architect`: the issue needs a design before the tests are written. Pick it when the issue adds a new type, module or public API whose shape the issue leaves open, touches
  several modules or slices that must agree, or makes a decision that would be hard to reverse. Leave it out for a fix or a change whose shape the issue already spells out.
- `ui`: the issue adds or changes Blazor components or pages (`.razor` files, their code-behind, layout or Tailwind styling).
- `scribe`: the issue adds or changes a domain term in `CONTEXT.md`, or changes how the Template is set up or used (`README.md` prose, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` or another
  hand-written guide).

An empty list, `[]`, means the issue needs none of them. If you leave `roles` out, every optional role runs.

# FILES

For each issue you pick, list in `files` the paths, relative to the repository root, that you expect the issue to change: the files it edits, adds or deletes, its tests
included. Read the repository to find them. The host builds no two issues at once that name the same path, nor an issue that names a path an open pull request changes. An
issue with no `files`, or an empty list, is treated as touching anything, and is built only on its own, so name every path you can.

# OUTPUT

Output your plan as a JSON object wrapped in `<plan>` tags:

<plan>
{"issues": [
{"id": "42", "title": "Fix auth bug", "roles": [], "files": ["src/UI/Program.cs", "tests/UI.Tests.Integration/ProgramTests.cs"]},
{"id": "43", "title": "Add a Palette picker", "roles": ["architect", "ui", "scribe"], "files": ["src/UI/Components/Features/Palettes/PaletteMenu.razor", "CONTEXT.md"]}
]}
</plan>

Include only unblocked issues. If every issue is blocked, include the single highest-priority candidate (the one with the fewest or weakest dependencies).

Always emit the `<plan>` tags, even when there is nothing to do. If there are no issues to work on at all, output `<plan>{"issues": []}</plan>` so the run can exit cleanly.

# RULES

You only read and plan: you commit nothing. These rules apply to every role:
