// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Overlap check
//
// Before the critique runs, the host defers, in code and with no agent, any
// pick whose predicted `files` (lib/plan.mts) share a path with a pick kept
// earlier in the planner's order or with an open pull request into main, from
// any author or queue. Two builds of one file conflict once the first merges
// (#421). A folder covers the paths under it. A pick with no files, or an
// empty list, is treated as touching anything: it waits behind the first kept
// pick or open PR, and with neither, the first such pick is built and the rest
// wait behind it. Each deferral is a hold, released if what it waits on is a
// pick that opens no PR this round (see lastingHolds).
