# TASK

Make the tests pass for issue {{TASK_ID}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

Only work on the issue specified. You can't reach GitHub from here, and don't need to: everything the issue says is above.

Work on branch {{BRANCH}}. It may already hold earlier commits for this issue. Build on them, don't redo them.

You are the UI developer. The tester committed failing tests for the issue's acceptance criteria, then the backend developer made every test pass except those for Blazor
components and pages. Your job is to build those components and pages, and make their tests pass.

The architect may have written a design note for this issue at `.sandcastle/work/{{TASK_ID}}/design.md`. When it exists, read it first and follow it. Where you have to depart
from it, say what and why in your commit body, so the reviewer can check the difference is explained.

# CONTEXT

Here are the last 10 commits:

<recent-commits>

!`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

</recent-commits>

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to complete the task.

Read `CONTEXT.md` for the domain language, `docs/adr/` for recorded decisions, and the standards for the stack the issue touches: `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`, especially its
Blazor section, and `.claude/rules/blazor.md` for components and pages, and `.claude/rules/sandcastle.md` for Sandcastle's TypeScript in `.sandcastle/`.

Read the tester's and the backend developer's commits on this branch first: the tests are the specification you implement, and the backend's code is what your components call.

Style with Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes, use the domain terms from `CONTEXT.md` in markup (Theme for light/dark, Palette for accent colour), and keep pages that don't need
interactivity statically rendered.

# SKILLS

For .NET work, these skills are mounted into the sandbox from the host's `~/.claude/skills/`. Use them where they apply:

- `dotnet-tdd`: the red-green-refactor loop with xUnit v3
- `dotnet-add-testing`: scaffolding a new test project
- `dotnet-xunit`: xUnit v3 conventions
- `dotnet-testing-strategy`: choosing unit, integration, or E2E tests
- `dotnet-project-analysis`: solution, project, and Central Package Management wiring
- `dotnet-inspect`: checking a NuGet package's API surface

# EXECUTION

Work test-first (red → green → refactor), one failing test at a time:

1. RED: pick a failing acceptance test, or write a smaller unit test of your own for a piece the acceptance tests need, and run it to watch it fail
2. GREEN: write the least implementation that passes it
3. REPEAT until every test passes
4. REFACTOR with the tests green

Never weaken the tester's tests to make them pass: don't remove or loosen an assertion, skip or todo a test in any form (xUnit's `Skip`, `SkipUnless`,
`SkipWhen`, `Explicit = true` or `Assert.Skip*`; `node:test`'s `.skip`, `.todo`, `{ skip }`, `{ todo }`, `t.skip()` or `t.todo()`), comment a test out, or delete
one. When a test is wrong rather than the code, leave it as it is and say why in your commit body.

# RULES

{{SHARED_RULES}}

# THE ISSUE

Your run is the last developer run, so the tests must pass by its end. If the task is not complete, say what was done and what remains in your last commit's body.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
