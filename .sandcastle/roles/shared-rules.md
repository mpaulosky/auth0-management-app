# Shared role rules

## Build and tests

An issue changes one stack or both. Use the commands for each stack the issue touches:

| Stack | Where | Build (every commit passes it) | Run tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .NET | `src/`, `tests/` | `dotnet build Blazor-Server.slnx`, with no warnings (`TreatWarningsAsErrors` is on) | `dotnet test --project tests/<Project>/<Project>.csproj` |
| Sandcastle's TypeScript | `.sandcastle/`, `package.json` | `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p .sandcastle`, with no errors | `pnpm exec tsx --test <file>.test.mts` |
| pnpm workspace | `package.json`, `src/UI/package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | run `pnpm install` after changing a `package.json`, and commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` in the same commit | the tests of the stack that uses the package |

- Tests must pass by the end of the last developer run, not on every commit.
- The .NET build of `src/UI` runs the Tailwind CLI from `src/UI`'s pnpm packages, so it fails with an error naming `pnpm install` when they're missing.
- The standards for each stack: `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md` for .NET, and `.claude/rules/sandcastle.md` for `.sandcastle/`.

## The gate

`scripts/gate.sh` is the one definition of "ready to push". It lints the changed YAML and Markdown files, runs the Sandcastle check when `.sandcastle/`, `package.json` or the pnpm lockfile changed,
builds the solution in Release and runs every test project, stopping at the first failure. Run it rather than the individual lint, build and test commands.

- If you committed anything, run `scripts/gate.sh` once as your last step, before `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`, and fix what it reports.
- The tester is exempt, because its tests are red on purpose. It still builds and lints the files it changed.
- The architect is exempt too. It commits at most one ADR, and lints that file with `pnpm exec markdownlint-cli2 <file>`.
- After you finish, the host runs the gate itself. Its exit code decides whether the branch is published, not what you report.
- Leave the worktree clean: commit or discard every change before you finish. Only commits are pushed, so the host fails the gate when anything is left uncommitted.

## Commits

Commit in small steps. Each message follows `.github/instructions/git-commit-instructions.md`:

- Subject: `<type>(<scope>): <Summary>`, for example `test(Domain): Add Result null-conversion test` or `feat(Domain): Port Result with targeted fixes`
- Body: what changed and why, key decisions, and any blockers for the next run
- Footer: `Refs #<issue number>`

## GitHub

Never push, never run `gh`, and never write to GitHub. The sandbox has no GitHub token. The host publishes the branch and does every GitHub write.
