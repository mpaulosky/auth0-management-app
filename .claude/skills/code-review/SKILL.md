# Code review

Review the pull request against this repository's own sources of truth. The rules below point at them and add what
they don't say. Every finding cites the file and rule it rests on.

## Sources of truth

Read the sections that govern the changed code before commenting on it:

- `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`: style, .NET and Blazor, Auth0, error handling with `Result`, FluentValidation,
  Vertical Slice Architecture, Central Package Management, and testing. It wins when another rule file
  disagrees.
- `CONTEXT.md`: the domain language (Template, Generated App, Theme, Palette, Visitor, User, Admin, Shared Kernel).
- `docs/adr/`: recorded decisions. A change that contradicts an ADR needs a new ADR that supersedes it.
- `.claude/rules/`: the path-scoped rules (Blazor, .NET, Markdown and blog posts).
- `docs/PROCESS.md`: branches, commits, PR titles and descriptions, and merging. The commit format is in
  `.github/instructions/git-commit-instructions.md`.

## What to check

**Domain language.** Code, UI text and docs use the `CONTEXT.md` terms with their defined meanings. Flag a synonym
(for example "color scheme" for Palette) or a term used for its neighbour (Theme for Palette).

**Shared Kernel boundary.** `src/Domain` holds only operation outcomes (`Result`, `Result<T>`, `ResultErrorCode`) and
the names the Template relies on (`ApplicationConstants`), and it references no other project and no package. Flag
entities, feature logic, validators, persistence types, or a new reference there; feature code belongs in
`src/UI/Components/Features/<Feature>/`.

**Feature slices.** Each slice keeps everything its use case needs in its own `src/UI/Components/Features/<Feature>/`
folder (ADR 0005), and no slice uses another slice's types. `src/UI` references no project other than `src/Domain`.
`tests/Architecture.Tests` enforces both, so flag a change that loosens those tests or works around them, for example
by reaching another slice's types through reflection. App-wide layout and pages stay in `Components/Layout/` and
`Components/Pages/`.

**Tests.** Every new or changed behaviour has a test, following the Testing section of `CODING_STANDARDS.md`. For a
`Result`-returning handler, that means its success value and each error code it can return.

**Markdown.** Lines outside tables stay within 200 characters; table rows can't wrap, so they're exempt. CI's
markdownlint enforces this and the other rules in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, except in the paths it ignores, such as
the generated posts in `docs/blogs/`.

**Workflows and hooks.** Steps that publish anything (open a PR, push, tag, release) run only for `main`: a
`github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` check, or a merged-into-`main` condition as in `release.yml`. `workflow_dispatch`
runs on any branch, and pull request runs check out a detached merge commit. Branch names in hooks, prompts and
docs follow `feature/{issue}-{slug}`, `fix/{issue}-{slug}`, `hotfix/{issue}-{slug}` or `chore/{slug}`.

**Sandcastle prompts.** In `.sandcastle/*-prompt.md`, an exclamation mark followed by a backtick runs the text up to
the next backtick as a shell command before the agent sees the prompt. Flag that sequence anywhere it isn't an
intended command expansion, for example in inline code about the null-forgiving operator.

**Sandcastle role prompts can always finish.** When a change touches `.sandcastle/*-prompt.md` or
`.sandcastle/roles/`, follow every case the prompt allows and check that each one ends in a reachable
`<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`, including an exemption, a re-run whose work is already committed, and "nothing to do".
Flag any instruction that contradicts an exemption stated elsewhere in the same prompt or in another role's prompt,
for example a tester exempt from manual criteria who can only finish after committing a failing test, or a reviewer
told to add a test for every missing criterion, including the exempt ones. No lint catches these: read the prompts
together.

## Out of scope

Leave compiler and analyzer findings to the build: `TreatWarningsAsErrors` and `AnalysisMode=All` already fail CI on
them, and Central Package Management rejects a `Version` on a `PackageReference`. Spend comments on behaviour,
boundaries, tests and intent.
