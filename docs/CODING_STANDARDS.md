# Coding Standards

<!-- Customize this file with your project's coding standards.
     CLAUDE.md imports it, so every Claude Code session (including each Sandcastle role) starts with it loaded,
     and the Sandcastle reviewer loads it again via @docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md in review-prompt.md. -->

## Style

`.editorconfig` at the repo root is the source of truth. This section summarizes the rules from it that matter in review. If the two disagree, `.editorconfig` wins.

### Formatting

- UTF-8, LF line endings, a final newline, and no trailing whitespace (Markdown may keep trailing whitespace).
- C#, `.csproj`, Razor, HTML, CSS, JS/TS, JSON, and XML: indent with tabs at a display width of 2.
- Markdown and YAML: indent with 2 spaces.
- Allman braces: every opening brace goes on its own line, and `else`, `catch`, and `finally` start a new line.
- Always use braces, even for single-statement blocks.
- Put `using` directives outside the namespace, with `System.*` first and a blank line between groups.

### C# language preferences

- Don't use `var`. Write the explicit type.
- Don't qualify members with `this.`.
- Use keyword types (`int`, `string`) rather than BCL names (`Int32`, `String`).
- Declare accessibility modifiers on every non-interface member, in this order:
  `public private protected internal file static extern new virtual abstract sealed override readonly unsafe required volatile async`.
- Add parentheses to arithmetic, relational, and other binary expressions when they make precedence clearer.
- Mark fields `readonly` when they're never reassigned, and mark local functions `static` when they don't capture state. The build enforces both, so a reviewer doesn't need to look for them.
- Use expression bodies for properties, accessors, indexers, and lambdas. Use block bodies for methods, constructors, operators, and local functions.
- Prefer modern expressions: pattern matching (`is null`, `is not`, `is T x`), switch expressions, `?.`, `??`, compound assignment, throw expressions, object and collection initializers, index and
  range operators, deconstruction, and `using` declarations instead of `using` blocks.
- Use `_` to discard unused values.

### Naming

| Symbol | Style | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Namespaces, classes, structs, enums | PascalCase | `OrderService` |
| Interfaces | `I` + PascalCase | `IOrderRepository` |
| Type parameters | `T` + PascalCase | `TResult` |
| Methods, properties, events, local functions | PascalCase | `GetOrders` |
| Public and internal fields | PascalCase | `MaxRetries` |
| Constants and `static readonly` fields, any accessibility | PascalCase | `DefaultTimeout` |
| Private and protected instance fields | `_` + camelCase | `_orderRepository` |
| Private and protected `static` fields that aren't `readonly` | `s_` + camelCase | `s_instanceCount` |
| Locals, local constants, parameters | camelCase | `orderId` |

### Documentation and comments

- Every public type and member outside test projects needs an XML doc comment (`/// <summary>`). The build enforces this (CS1591). Review the comments for accuracy, not presence.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Flag comments that just restate the code.

## C# and .NET

- Target .NET 10 and C# 14. `global.json` pins the SDK. When documentation and repository configuration disagree, the configuration wins.
- Use current language features where they make code clearer: primary constructors, collection expressions (`[]`), records for immutable data, file-scoped namespaces, and `required` members.
- Keep nullable reference types enabled. Don't silence them with `!` unless a comment explains why the value can't be null.
- Use `async`/`await` all the way down.
  Never call `.Result`, `.Wait()`, or `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` on a task, and never write `async void` except for event handlers.
  Async methods end in `Async` and accept a `CancellationToken` when the work can be cancelled.
- Never use `Thread.Sleep` in production code.
- Get dependencies through constructor injection (or `[Inject]` in components). Don't `new` up services or use a service locator.
- Never hardcode secrets, connection strings, or Auth0 credentials. Read them from `IConfiguration`, environment variables, or user secrets.
- No empty `catch` blocks. At minimum, log the exception and rethrow. Catch specific exception types rather than `Exception` unless you're at a top-level boundary.
- Validate requests with FluentValidation: one `AbstractValidator<T>` per request, kept in the feature's folder and registered in DI.
  Handlers validate again on the server and return validation failures as a failed `Result`.
  Don't mix in DataAnnotations for request validation.
- Validate and sanitize all user input. Flag any place where user input reaches output, queries, or redirects unchecked.
- Log through `ILogger<T>` with structured message templates (`"Loaded {Count} items"`), not string interpolation.
- Keep NuGet additions minimal, and justify each new package in the PR description.

### Central Package Management

The repo uses [Central Package Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/central-package-management) (CPM).

- `Directory.Packages.props` at the repo root sets `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` to `true` and holds every package version as a `<PackageVersion Include="..." Version="..." />`.
- In `.csproj` files, `<PackageReference>` elements have no `Version` attribute. Restore fails with NU1008 if one does.
- Don't use `VersionOverride`. If a project needs a different version, change the central version, or explain the exception in the PR.
- Add a new package in two places: its version in `Directory.Packages.props`, and a version-less reference in the project that uses it. Keep entries alphabetical.
- Put shared build settings (`TargetFramework`, `Nullable`, `ImplicitUsings`, `TreatWarningsAsErrors`, analyzer settings) in `Directory.Build.props`, not in individual project files.

### Blazor

- Use the component lifecycle methods (`OnInitializedAsync`, `OnParametersSetAsync`) instead of doing work in constructors.
- Keep markup in `.razor` files. Move non-trivial logic into a code-behind (`.razor.cs`) or an injected service.
- Use `EventCallback` for child-to-parent communication. Call `StateHasChanged()` only when Blazor can't detect the change itself.
- Style UI with Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes. Avoid inline `style` attributes and one-off CSS.
- Style every surface for light and dark with `dark:` variants. The `dark` variant follows the OS until the visitor picks a Theme
  (see [docs/plans/ui-restyle.md](plans/ui-restyle.md)).
- Write accent colour as `accent-*` (`bg-accent-600`), never as a raw hue such as `blue-*`, so the Palette can swap it.
- Surfaces, borders, dividers and hover fills use `accent-*` too, so the Palette tints them (see [docs/plans/palette-tint.md](plans/palette-tint.md)).
  Text stays `slate-*`: secondary text is `slate-600` in Light and `slate-300` in Dark.
  Pair every `focus-visible:outline-accent-500` with `dark:focus-visible:outline-accent-300`.
  The Palette menu's panel and tiles stay slate, so its swatches read true.
  Colours with a fixed meaning, such as the amber warning and the badge tones, keep their hue.
- Put reusable UI building blocks (card, badge, button) in `Components/Shared/`. They hold no feature or domain logic, aren't the Shared Kernel, and never depend on a feature slice.
- Call JavaScript interop only from `OnAfterRenderAsync`, never while the component is prerendering. Guard one-time setup with `if (firstRender)`.
- When a component subscribes to events, starts timers, or holds a `CancellationTokenSource`, implement `IDisposable` or `IAsyncDisposable` and release them.
- Wrap UI updates that come from outside Blazor's event handlers, such as timers, events, and background tasks, in `await InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged)`.
- Scoped services live for the user's whole connection (circuit), not for one request. Don't keep per-request data in them, and never keep per-user state in singletons.
- Don't use `HttpContext` in interactive components. Read the signed-in user through `AuthenticationStateProvider` or a cascading `Task<AuthenticationState>`.
- Declare render modes explicitly where the component defines them (`@rendermode InteractiveServer`). Keep pages that don't need interactivity statically rendered.
- Use the domain terms from `CONTEXT.md` in code and UI.
  For example, **Theme** means light/dark mode and **Palette** means the hue that tints the accent and the surfaces.
  Don't use either word for the other, or swap in synonyms like "color scheme".

### Authentication and authorization (Auth0)

- Sign-in uses `Auth0.AspNetCore.Authentication` with cookie sessions.
  Access and refresh tokens stay on the server.
  Never send them to the browser, write them to logs, or store them in `localStorage`.
- Bind `Auth0:Domain`, `Auth0:ClientId`, and `Auth0:ClientSecret` from configuration (`Auth0__Domain` and so on in environment variables). Never commit them.
- Map the Auth0 role claim to `ClaimTypes.Role` in one place at startup, so `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` and `<AuthorizeView Roles="Admin">` work everywhere.
- Protect pages with `[Authorize]` or named policies. Use `<AuthorizeView>` only to show or hide UI. It isn't a security boundary, so the page or handler must still enforce access.
- Login and logout endpoints must redirect only to local URLs. Validate any `returnUrl` with `Url.IsLocalUrl`, or use `LocalRedirect`.

### Error handling and configuration

- Handlers return a `Result` or `Result<T>` (defined once in the Domain project) for expected failures such as validation errors, not-found, and forbidden. Don't use exceptions for control flow.
- Throw exceptions only for truly unexpected failures, such as bugs, infrastructure outages, and violated invariants.
  Let them reach the global error handler or an `<ErrorBoundary>` rather than catching them to return a failed `Result`.
- Callers must check a `Result` before using its value. Components show `Result` errors to the user, and endpoints map them to `ProblemDetails` with the matching status code.
- Carry a stable error code (for example `"Palette.Unknown"`) and a human-readable message on each error, so tests can assert on the code.
- Bind settings with the options pattern:
  `services.AddOptions<TOptions>().BindConfiguration("Section").ValidateDataAnnotations().ValidateOnStart()`.
  Inject `IOptions<T>` (or `IOptionsMonitor<T>`), not `IConfiguration`, into feature code.

## Testing

### Frameworks

- **xUnit v3** (`xunit.v3.mtp-v2`) on Microsoft.Testing.Platform, as configured in `global.json`. Collect coverage with `Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage`, not coverlet.
- **FluentAssertions** for every assertion. Don't use xUnit's `Assert.*`.
- **NSubstitute** for test doubles. Only substitute interfaces, never concrete classes.
- **bUnit** for Blazor component tests.
- **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing`** (`WebApplicationFactory<Program>`) for integration tests of endpoints, middleware, authorization policies, and DI wiring.
- **Playwright** for end-to-end tests.
  Keep Playwright tests in `*.Tests.E2E` projects.
  CI builds any project that references `Microsoft.Playwright` and installs its browsers, and supplies Auth0 settings and a test user for each role through environment variables.
  E2E tests start the app through the Aspire AppHost.
  Read credentials from configuration, and never hardcode them.

### Conventions

- Put test projects under `tests/`, named `<Project>.Tests.<Kind>` (`UI.Tests.Unit`, `UI.Tests.Integration`, `UI.Tests.E2E`) or `Architecture.Tests`, as in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  `Directory.Build.props` applies test-only settings to any project whose name contains `.Tests`.
  Mirror the namespaces and folder layout of the production code they cover.
- Name test methods `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult`. `.editorconfig` suppresses CA1707 in tests to allow the underscores.
- Structure every test as Arrange/Act/Assert, marked with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, and `// Assert` comments. All three comments are required, even when a section is empty.
- Test one behavior per test. Use `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` or `[MemberData]` instead of copy-pasting near-identical `[Fact]`s.
- Pass `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken` to async calls under test.
- Use `IAsyncLifetime` (which returns `ValueTask` in v3) for async setup and teardown, and class or collection fixtures for expensive shared setup.
- Write tests first (TDD) for new features and bug fixes. Every behavior a change adds or modifies needs a test.
- Tests must be deterministic: no `Thread.Sleep`, no dependency on the wall clock (inject `TimeProvider`), and no dependency on test order.
- Test behavior through public APIs. Don't assert on private state or reach in with reflection.
- In integration tests, replace external services (Auth0, HTTP APIs) through `WebApplicationFactory.WithWebHostBuilder` and `ConfigureTestServices`.
  Use a test authentication handler instead of calling Auth0.
- Test both paths of every `Result`-returning handler: the success value and each expected error code.
- CI fails the build when line coverage drops below the threshold in `.github/ci/coverage-threshold` (80%). Still treat untested new behavior as a review finding, whatever the percentage.

### Example

```csharp
public class ThemeServiceTests
{
	private readonly ICookieStore _cookieStore = Substitute.For<ICookieStore>();
	private readonly ThemeService _sut;

	public ThemeServiceTests()
	{
		_sut = new ThemeService(_cookieStore);
	}

	[Fact]
	public async Task GetThemeAsync_NoCookieSet_ReturnsSystemDefault()
	{
		// Arrange
		_cookieStore.GetAsync("theme", Arg.Any<CancellationToken>()).Returns((string?)null);

		// Act
		Theme result = await _sut.GetThemeAsync(TestContext.Current.CancellationToken);

		// Assert
		result.Should().Be(Theme.System);
	}

	[Theory]
	[InlineData("light", Theme.Light)]
	[InlineData("dark", Theme.Dark)]
	public async Task GetThemeAsync_CookieSet_ReturnsStoredTheme(string cookieValue, Theme expected)
	{
		// Arrange
		_cookieStore.GetAsync("theme", Arg.Any<CancellationToken>()).Returns(cookieValue);

		// Act
		Theme result = await _sut.GetThemeAsync(TestContext.Current.CancellationToken);

		// Assert
		result.Should().Be(expected);
		await _cookieStore.Received(1).GetAsync("theme", Arg.Any<CancellationToken>());
	}
}
```

## Architecture

### Vertical Slice Architecture

Code is organized by feature, not by technical layer. Each slice holds everything one use case needs, from the UI down to data access.

- Each feature lives in its own folder under `Features/`, for example `Features/Themes/` or `Features/Profile/`.
  Name the folder in the plural when a type in it has the singular name (the `Theme` type in `Features/Themes/`): a type named like its own namespace doesn't compile from a sibling namespace.
  Its folder holds the feature's components, request and response types, handler, validator, and endpoints.
- Don't add top-level `Services/`, `Repositories/`, `Models/`, or `Controllers/` folders that collect code from many features.
- Slices don't reference each other's internals. When two slices need the same logic, move it out of the slice, but only once a second slice actually needs it:
  a component to `Components/Shared/`, and other code to a top-level `src/UI/<Concern>/` folder, such as `src/UI/Security/` (see [ADR 0007](adr/0007-cross-cutting-code-outside-the-slices.md)).
- Keep both small: cross-cutting concerns only. Feature logic never goes there, and neither depends on a slice.
- Model requests and responses as `record`s, and name them after the use case (`GetProfileQuery`, `SetPaletteCommand`), not after the entity.
- Handlers are ordinary classes registered in DI, with one handler per use case. Don't add a mediator library without an ADR.
- Register each slice's services in an extension method inside the slice, such as `services.AddThemeFeature()`, so `Program.cs` stays a list of feature registrations.
- Test projects mirror the `Features/` layout, so each slice's tests sit together.
- Duplicating code between slices is acceptable. Only extract shared code when the duplicated logic really is the same concept, not just similar-looking code.

### General

- Keep each class focused on one responsibility. Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Depend on interfaces at boundaries such as cookies, Auth0, HTTP, and the clock, so tests can substitute them.
  Don't add an interface for a class that has only one implementation and doesn't sit at a boundary.
- Protect pages with authorization attributes and policies (`[Authorize]`, `[Authorize(Roles = ...)]`) rather than checking claims by hand in markup.
