## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a code of conduct from the Contributor Covenant.
Contributors to this project are expected to adhere to this code.
Please report unwanted behavior to [Project Maintainer](mailto:matthew.paulosky@outlook.com)

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Follow [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md): the one-time hook setup, a branch named to the standard in its own worktree,
   commit and PR title format, the PR description, and how checks, review, merging and releases work.
3. Make your changes, following the code style and guidelines below, with tests.
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request to `main` using the template.

## What should I know before I get started

This project is a GitHub template for a server-rendered Blazor Web App built with .NET 10, C# 14, Tailwind CSS v4, and Auth0 authentication. See [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md) for the domain language.

### Code Style & Commit Messages

- Follow the coding standards in [CODING_STANDARDS.md](CODING_STANDARDS.md) and the formatting rules in `.editorconfig`.
- Commits and PR titles follow [git-commit-instructions.md](../.github/instructions/git-commit-instructions.md)
  (`<type>(<scope>): <Summary>`); see [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md#commits-and-pr-titles).
- Add comments to explain *why* for complex logic.

### Project Folder Structure

This project is designed to be built and run primarily with [your preferred IDEs/editors].
The folders are configured so that they will support editing and working in other editors and on other operating systems.
We encourage you to develop with these other environments, because we would like to be able to support developers who use those tools as well.
The folders are configured as follows:

```text

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for more details.

All official versions of the project are built and delivered with [your CI/CD system, e.g., GitHub Actions] and linked in the main README.md and [releases tab in your repository].

### Design Decisions

Design for this project is ultimately decided by the project team lead ([maintainer name or role]). The following project tenets are adhered to when making decisions:

1. Use server-rendered Blazor with Tailwind CSS v4 for the UI.
1. Use Auth0 for authentication and role-based authorization.
1. Organize code with Vertical Slice Architecture: one folder per feature, not per technical layer.
1. Return `Result`/`Result<T>` for expected failures, and validate requests with FluentValidation.
1. Use .NET Aspire for local orchestration and end-to-end test hosting.
1. Manage NuGet versions centrally in `Directory.Packages.props`.

If you have suggestions, please open an issue or discuss in your pull request.

### How can I contribute

We are always looking for help on this project. There are several ways that you can help:
This means one of several types of contributions:

1. [Create an Issue](#create-an-issue)
1. [Respond to an Issue](#respond-to-an-issue)
1. [Write code](#write-code)
1. [Write documentation](#write-documentation)

## Contribution Types

- **Report a Bug:** Please add the `Bug` label so we can triage and track it.
- **Suggest an Enhancement:** Add the `Enhancement` label for new features or improvements.
- **Write Code:** All code should be linked to an issue. Include or update tests for new features and bug fixes.
- **Write Documentation:** Help us improve `/docs` and keep the main [README.md](../README.md) up to date.

### Create an Issue

Create a [New Issue Here](https://github.com/mpaulosky/Blazor-Server/issues).

1. If you are reporting a `Bug` that you have found. Be sure to add the `Bug` label so that we can triage and track it.
1. If you are reporting an `Enhancement` that you think would improve the project. Be sure to add the `Enhancement`
   label so we can track it.

Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and screenshots if helpful.

### Respond to an Issue

[Fork the Repository to your account](https://github.com/mpaulosky/Blazor-Server/fork).

1. Leave an issue labelled `sandcastle:building` alone: Sandcastle is building it right now, and two people or agents editing the same files would race to publish.
   The label clears when the build ends.
1. Create a branch in its own worktree, named for the existing Issue number (`feature/{issue}-{slug}` or `fix/{issue}-{slug}`); see [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md#branches-and-worktrees).
1. Work on the issue.
1. Create Unit, Integration tests for any code that require them. We use xUnit v3, FluentAssertions, NSubstitute, bUnit, and Playwright to test our code and components.
1. When you are done, create a Pull Request from your branch to `main`.
1. Submit the Pull Request.

**Note:** Pull requests without unit tests will be delayed until tests are added. All new features and bug fixes must
include appropriate tests.

#### Running the E2E tests locally

`tests/UI.Tests.E2E` uses Playwright to drive headless Chromium against `UI`, started through the Aspire AppHost as
the `WebApp` resource. Run it like any other test project:

```bash
dotnet test --project tests/UI.Tests.E2E/UI.Tests.E2E.csproj
```

There's no separate browser install step: the test fixture installs Chromium itself on the first run, and skips the
download once it's there. On Linux, Chromium also needs its system libraries; if it fails to start with an error about a
missing shared library, install them once with `pnpm dlx playwright install-deps chromium` (it needs root).

Set `PLAYWRIGHT_ARTIFACTS=true` to save a Playwright trace for each test under
`tests/UI.Tests.E2E/bin/<Configuration>/net10.0/TestResults/playwright-artifacts/`. CI sets it and uploads the traces,
and `pnpm dlx playwright show-trace <file>.zip` opens one.

Any code that is written to support a component or new functionality are required to be accompanied with unit tests at the time the pull request is submitted.
Pull requests without unit tests will be delayed and asked for unit tests to prove their functionality.

### Review Process

Every PR is reviewed by Copilot on each push, and merges once its required checks pass and every review thread is
resolved: a same-repo PR merges on its own, and the maintainer merges a fork's. The details are in
[PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md#checks-review-and-merging).

### Write code

All code should have an assigned issue that matches it. This way we can prevent contributors from working on the same
feature at the same time.

Code for components' features should also include some definition in the `/docs` folder so that our users can
identify and understand which feature is supported.

See [docs/](../docs) for feature documentation guidelines.

### Write documentation

The documentation for the project is always needed. We are always looking for help to add content to the `/docs`
section of the repository with proper links back through to the main `/README.md`.
