# Shared Kernel lives in a separate Domain project

Amended by [ADR 0005](0005-feature-slices-live-in-the-ui-project.md): there is no `Core` project; feature slices live in `UI` under `Components/Features/<Feature>/`.

The Template's building blocks that any Generated App needs (`Result`/`Result<T>` and the names the Template relies
on, such as the Admin policy, the role name, and the Theme and Palette cookie names) live in their own `src/Domain`
project. They don't live in `Core/Shared/`, as the Template originally planned. `Domain` references no other project
and no persistence package; the `Core` and `UI` projects, once they exist, reference it. This turns the
"cross-cutting only" rule into a project boundary that `Architecture.Tests` can enforce: `Domain` depends on nothing.

Despite the name, `Domain` holds no entities, aggregates or business rules. Feature logic will live in
`Core/Features/<Feature>/`. We kept the name `Domain` so it matches the sibling Articles solution, which makes moving
code and habits between the two repos easier.

## Considered Options

- **`Core/Shared/`**: the original plan. It's one project fewer, and in the planned layout `UI` already references
  `Core`. We rejected it because "keep `Shared/` small" is a convention, while a project with no references is a
  boundary the compiler and `Architecture.Tests` can enforce.
- **Naming it `SharedKernel`**: more accurate, but rejected to stay consistent with Articles.
- **Porting Articles' Domain wholesale (including `MongoDB.Bson`)**: rejected, because it would lock every Generated
  App into MongoDB.
